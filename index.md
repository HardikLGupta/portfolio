## Data Science
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses advance analytics, scientific methods, algorithms, computer programming and domain knowledge to extract actionable insights from large and ever-growing data. It's a vast and very interesting field which is very rewarding (both work and monetary wise). However it is equally rigorous, requires building analytical thinking and a commitment to life-long learning.

## My Learning Journey
My journey started in January 2016 which included understanding different aspect of this field from scratch. To summarise it involved answering

1. Why Data Science: Understand the importance of data and role it plays in building products and data monetisation
2. Components of Data Science: Understand different blocks - Programming, Statistics and Maths, Algorithms, Product thinking and Domain knowledge
3. Learn Data Science: Scouting for resources, from short term course to masters and still learning every single day

While this journey has been very rewarding, I realised all of this which I learnt over a period of time could be covered in a shorter time only if I had proper guidance or a mentor. And this where I can help.
