## Why Choose a Mentor
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that promises to be rewarding - both work and monetary wise. However it is equally rigorous, requires building analytical thinking and a commitment to life-long learning.

My journey started in January 2016 which included understanding different aspect from scratch. To summarise it involved answering

1. <p style="font-style: italic;">Why Data Science</p> Understand the importance of data and the role it plays in building products and data monetisation
2. <p style="font-style: italic;">Components of Data Science</p> Understand different blocks - Programming, Statistics and Maths, Algorithms, Product thinking and Domain knowledge
3. <p style="font-style: italic;">Learn Data Science</p> Scouting for resources, from short term course to masters and still learning every single day

While this journey has been very rewarding personally, I realised all of this which I learnt over a period of time could be covered in a shorter time only if I had proper guidance or a mentor. And this is where **I can help you**.
