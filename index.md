# Learning Journey with Data Science
---
## Mentorship Program

Main focus of this program is to assist you in identifying right resources to maximise learning and guide you in every decision of your learning journey. 


## Program Details

1. Understand your background and educate you whether this field is really meant for you (if you are a fresher).
2. Help you design a curriculum based on your current knowledge and background.
3. Identify resources which will maximise your learning (no compromise on quality) in shortest time.
4. Conduct multiple mock interviews before your big day so that you feel confident and don't fumble. 
5. Identify pain-points in your resume and help you build a strong portfolio.

## Data Science
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses advance analytics, scientific methods, algorithms, computer programming and domain knowledge to extract actionable insights from large and ever-growing data. It's a vast and very interesting field which is very rewarding (both work and monetary wise). However it is equally rigorous, requires building analytical thinking and a commitment to life-long learning.  


## My Learning Journey
My journey started in Jan 2016 which included understanding different aspect of this field from scratch. To summarise it involved answering

1. Why Data Science - Understand the importance of data and role it plays in building products and data monetisation
2. Components of Data Science - Understand different blocks - Programming, Statistics and Maths, Algorithms, Product thinking and Domain knowledge
3. Learn Data Science - Scouting for resources, from short term course to masters and still learning every single day

While this journey has been very rewarding, I realised all of this which I learnt over a period of time could be covered in a shorter time only if I had proper guidance or a mentor. And this where I can help.
